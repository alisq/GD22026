<h3>Interviewed by Ali Qadeer</h3>

<p>
<strong>What music do you like to listen to while working?</strong><br />
pop music. Keshi. It's calm. I don't like to listen to music without lyrics but I don't like to listen to something that's too heavy that I focus too much on the music rather than what i'm doing.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Name three designers whose work you find inspiring.</strong><br />
    <ul>
        <li>Alan Peters likes to redesign logos on Instagram. Often better than the original</li>
        <li>Ordinary Folk - Motion designers work with hand drawn things. Fake 3D</li>
        <li>Austin Bauwens — Motion designers. Makes short edits to music and explainer videos</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Name something (a format, an item) you want to learn how to design but haven't had the chance to try out yet.</strong> <br />
A font. Script font. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>If you were a font, you'd be (you can't say helvetica or comic sans-- both jokes are played). Explain why?</strong><br />
A font with both Mandarin and English because I'm Chinese. 
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Name one website that you rely on (try to avoid a platform like google/amazon/pinterest/etc).</strong><br />
    <a href="https://www.stardewvalleywiki.com/Stardew_Valley_Wiki" target="_blank">Stardew Valley Wiki</a> - The game doesnt have a tutorial and it's so packed with stuff that I use the site to explore.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Now that you're in second year, what's different about graphic design from what you thought it was going in?</strong><br />
I thought it was just making things look good. In first year, I was telling one of my profs that and he said "you have to have a reason for your decisions."  That design isn't just making things look good, you should make something that makes people think.
